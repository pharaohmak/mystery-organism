# DNA Specimen Project

A JavaScript application that generates random DNA specimens, mutates their DNA, compares DNA similarities, and determines their likelihood of survival based on specific DNA characteristics.

## Introduction

The DNA Specimen Project simulates the creation of DNA specimens with random DNA strands. It includes functionality to mutate the DNA, compare DNA similarities between specimens, and determine the likelihood of a specimen's survival based on its DNA composition.

## Features

- Generates random DNA strands for specimens.
- Mutates a random base in the DNA strand.
- Compares DNA similarities between two specimens.
- Determines if a specimen is likely to survive based on its DNA.
- Displays a list of specimens that are likely to survive.
